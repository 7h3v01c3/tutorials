# Migrating Funds from a Backup Wallet in Divi Desktop

In this tutorial, we'll go over the process of migrating your funds from a backup wallet on Divi Desktop Wallet to another wallet, specifically a Divi wallet that was imported to the original wallet. Follow the steps carefully to ensure a successful migration.

---

## Step 1: Accessing AppData to Locate Backup Wallet

1. Press `Windows + R` on your keyboard to open the **Run** dialog box.
2. Type `%appdata%` and press **Enter**. This will open the **Roaming** folder inside your **AppData** directory.
3. Navigate to the following folder:
   ```
   AppData/Roaming/DIVI
   ```
4. In this folder, you will see a backup of your original wallet. Look for a file named something like:
   ```
   wallet_backup_2024-10-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx.dat
   ```
   (The exact date and time will vary based on when the backup was created.)
5. Copy the name of this file (e.g., `wallet_backup_2024-10-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx.dat`) and save it in **Notepad** for later use.

## Step 2: Log In to Divi Desktop and Open the Console

1. Launch your **Divi Desktop Wallet** and log in using your 12-word seed phrase wallet.
2. Open the **Console** by navigating to the **Help** tab and selecting **Debug Window**, then choose the **Console** tab.

---

## Step 3: Identify the Current Wallet

1. In the Console, run the following command to check which wallet you are currently using:
   ```bash
   getwalletinfo
   ```
2. You should see that you are using the default wallet, which is associated with your 12-word seed phrase wallet. This wallet file is typically named:
   ```
   wallet.dat
   ```

---

## Step 4: Load the Backup Wallet

1. You will now load your original wallet using the following command (replace the date with the one from the backup file you noted earlier):
   ```bash
   loadwallet wallet_backup_2024-10-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx.dat
   ```
2. Wait about 60 seconds for the wallet to load.
3. Verify which wallet you are currently using by running:
   ```bash
   getwalletinfo
   ```
   It should now display:
   ```
   wallet_backup_2024-10-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx.dat
   ```

---

## Step 5: Generate a New Address from the Backup Wallet

1. To generate a new address from the original backup wallet, run the following command:
   ```bash
   getnewaddress
   ```
2. This will give you a new address to which you will later send your funds.

---

## Step 6: Validate the New Address

1. Validate the address you just generated by using the following command:
   ```bash
   validateaddress <yournewaddress>
   ```
   Replace `<yournewaddress>` with the address you generated from the `getnewaddress` command.
2. Ensure that `ismine` is set to **true**. This confirms that the address belongs to your backup wallet.

---

## Step 7: Return to Your Seed Phrase Wallet

1. Now that you have a valid address from your backup wallet, switch back to your 12-word seed phrase wallet by loading the default wallet:
   ```bash
   loadwallet wallet.dat
   ```

---

## Step 8: Unlock Your Seed Phrase Wallet

1. To unlock your 12-word seed phrase wallet for sending funds, use the following command:
   ```bash
   walletpassphrase <yourpassword> 9999 false
   ```
   Replace `<yourpassword>` with the password you use to unlock your wallet.

---

## Step 9: Send Funds to the New Address

1. Once your wallet is unlocked, send your funds to the new address generated from the backup wallet:
   ```bash
   sendtoaddress <yournewaddress> <amount>
   ```
   Replace `<yournewaddress>` with the address from Step 5 and `<amount>` with the number of Divi coins you wish to send.

2. You will receive a **transaction hash (ID)**. Wait a few minutes for the transaction to process.

---

## Step 10: Load the Backup Wallet Again

1. After the transaction is confirmed, load the backup wallet again:
   ```bash
   loadwallet wallet_backup_2024-10-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx.dat
   ```
2. Verify that you are in the correct wallet by running:
   ```bash
   getwalletinfo
   ```

---

## Step 11: Check the Balance in the Backup Wallet

1. Run the following command to check your balance and confirm that the transferred amount has arrived:
   ```bash
   getbalance
   ```

---

## Step 12: Rename Wallet Files

1. Close **Divi Desktop** completely.
2. Open **File Explorer** and navigate back to:
   ```
   AppData/Roaming/DIVI
   ```
3. Rename the current `wallet.dat` file to `wallet.mobile`.
4. Rename your backup wallet (`wallet_backup_2024-10-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx.dat`) to `wallet.dat`.

---

## Step 13: Reopen Divi Desktop

1. Finally, reopen **Divi Desktop**. The application will now load your original wallet with the transferred funds.

---

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you successfully migrated your funds from the original backup wallet to the wallet associated with your 12-word seed phrase. Always ensure to keep a backup of your wallet files and store them in a safe location.
