# **DO NOT EVER SAVE YOUR SEED WORDS (seed phrases, recovery phrases) IN A TEXT DOCUMENT - EVER!**

## Mac Recovery of Divi Wallet in Divi Desktop Application

---

**Make sure the Divi Desktop Application is closed before starting.**

**Note: Don't forget to set a password for Divi Desktop after you have migrated into Divi Desktop.**

Hi everyone! In todayâ€™s tutorial, Iâ€™ll walk you through the process of recovering your Divi Wallet using the Divi Desktop Application on macOS. Weâ€™ll go step-by-step through the recovery process using your mnemonic (seed phrase) and the terminal.

Letâ€™s get started!

---

### Syntax for Recovery:
```
./divid -mnemonic="word1 word2 word3 word4 word5 word6 word7 word8 word9 word10 word11 word12" -force_rescan=1 &
```
**Note:** If you encounter the error:  
*Error: There is no RPC client functionality in divid anymore. Use the divi-cli utility instead.*,  
this usually indicates a syntax error. Review your command for missing or incorrect quotes (`"`), hyphens (`-`), or spelling mistakes.


### Path in Terminal:
```
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Divi\ Desktop/divid/unpacked/divi_osx
```

### Prep Work:
1. Divi Desktop should be installed, fully synced and shutdown.

## Step A: Prepare for Wallet Recovery

1. Open Finder and press `Command + Shift + G` to open the "Go to Folder" dialog.
2. Type or **copy and paste** the following command into the dialog, then press **Enter**:
     ```
     ~/Library/Application Support/
     ```
     - Click the copy icon to the right or highlight the command above and press Command + C. To paste, press Command + V in the dialong box.
     
     Example:
     Open AppData / Roaming in Finder Search as shown below:

3. Navigate to the **DIVI** folder (not Divi Desktop).
   - Locate wallet.dat

     Example:
     Open DIVI foloder and locate wallet.dat:

5. Rename `wallet.dat` to `wallet_backup.dat`.
   *Note: macOS may ask for permission.* If you make a mistake with the name or extension, simply start over, then proceed to step 5.
   Example:
   Rename wallet.dat by using CRTL + Click the file or with wallet.data highlighted chose file > rename in Finder:

6. Now, move back up one level in finder and enter into the **Divi Desktop** folder.
   - Navigate to the `Divi Desktop` directory inside `Application Support`.
   - Open the **Divi Desktop** folder (not `DIVI`).

7. Delete the `divitxs.db` file:
   - Inside the **Divi Desktop** folder, find and delete the `divitxs.db` file.  
   - If the file extension isn't visible, it may appear as `divitxs`.

     Example:
     Delete the divitxs.db file:

3. Before running the daemon, make it executable:
   - **Copy and paste** the following command into the Terminal and press **Enter**:
     ```bash
     chmod +x *
     ```
     - To copy, click the copy icon to the right or highlight the command above and press Command + C. To paste, press Command + V in the Terminal.

4. Now, run the following recovery command, replacing `word1` through `word12` with your actual seed words and hit ENTER!
    ```
    ./divid -mnemonic="word1 word2 word3 word4 word5 word6 word7 word8 word9 word10 word11 word12" -force_rescan=1 &
    ```
    Make sure your seed words are all lowercase, with a single space between each word.
   Example:
   Either copy to a note you dont save or paste on command lined and edit using right and left arrow keys.
